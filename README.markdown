# Sparc.Mvc
This library provides a slightly more flexible alternative to Razor's sections.

The primary goals of this project are:

* To allow a child page to completely overwrite a block defined in one of its layouts
* Insert content into a block defined in one of the layouts
* Conditionally render a block only if a child page also defines the block
* Define a block once (and never needed to re-define in a nested layout page)

# Usage
To use, your pages can inherit from Sparc.Mvc.BlockablePage, or you can call Sparc.Mvc.BlockablePage.RenderBlock or Sparc.Mvc.BlockablePage.DefineBlock.  To make your pages inherit from BlockablePage, modify the pages element in your web.config (not the primary web.config) to have this entry: <pages pageBaseType="Sparc.Mvc.BlockablePage">

    // Render a block, and require it to be defined (required defaults to false).
    @RenderBlock("MainHeader").Required()
    
    // Define and render a block at the same time, allowing children to insert content into the block.
    @RenderBlock("MainHeader").As(@<h1>Hello @RenderBlock("MainHeader")</h1>)
    
    // Define a block.
    @DefineBlock("MainHeader").As(@<h1>This is some content</h1>)
    
    // Define a block which requires a child view to also define the block.
    @DefineBlock("MainHeader").Required().As(@<div id="main-header" style="font-size: 3em">Header[ @RenderBlock("MainHeader") ]</div>)

    // Define a block which renders a default message if no child view defines the block.
    @DefineBlock("MainHeader").IfDefined(@<h1>@RenderBlock("MainHeader")</h1>).Else(@<p>Main header wasn't defined.</p>)
    
    // Define a block which overwrites any previous/parent definitions of the block.
    @DefineBlock("MainHeader").As(@<h1>Hello World!</h1>).OverwriteParents()
